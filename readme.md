## Deliverable 
- Simple Django app that shows utilization of a Django Rest Framework
- Ability to utilize core/built-in functionality of Django and (third party library) Django Rest Framework
- 1-2 Django ORM Models - names / attributes of applicants chosing, at least one model should relate to another
- database doesnâ€™t matter, default django db (SQLite) is ok
- DjangoRestFramework views for the django models (standard/stock api actions are enough)
- No need to create a webpage screen - no front end - just code review
Review process:
- Set up Github repo and invite dev team members
- Team is looking for the ability for you to create and implement functional code that  leverages built in functionality of Django and DRF
- interactive code review process after merging your submission to simulate interaction model with the team

## Outcome

- Simple Django app built upon Django Rest Framework.
- PostGres and PostGIS used as a database.
- 3 ORM Models: Company, Driver, Truck
- Each 'Driver' has a FK attribute 'company_id'
- Each 'Truck' has a FK attribute 'driver_id'
- Ability to create, update, and delete an ORM model based on PK
- Ability to list all of a specified ORM model.
- Created view to use PostGIS to return the truck closest to a given lat,lng coordinate.
